## Implemented

### ✓ Node Discovery:

- ✓ ArtPoll Parser
- ✓ ArtPollReply Serialization

### ✓ DMX Lighting Control:
- ✓ ArtDMX Parser

### ✓ Re-Programming
- ✓ ArtCommand Parser

## But what about everything else?

- Right now this library contains enough to build a minimal ArtNet node and not much more.
- If your interested in adding a feature pull requests are welcome.
